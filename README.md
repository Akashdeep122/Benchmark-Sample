Useful for getting Quick Benchmarks Before Playing a game (or maybe coding too)

All You need is python to run all this (ill maybe upload an exe file for it aswell), rest run all this in terminal and then you will get final score after running all this, the txt file is a sample notepad output that you will get

The 2w1a Snapshot is Secure to run and use credits to the Threding library and its got a way better user interface , Make sure to Download tkinter and Threding Module to be able to use it Thanks.

As for 1w4a The Exe has been put and you should download the whole folder and maybe we will make one for the gui one too but it needs some bug Fixes, ALSO NO NEED to install python or any library :)

PLEASE MENTION : Using the Latest Snapshot 2w2a in Tkinter is More faster and FIxed a bug where 1 Thread was being run twice resulting in Scores being twice as they should be , We have fixed the error so Please Consider using Snapshot 2w2a
