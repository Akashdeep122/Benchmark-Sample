# Benchmark-Sample
Useful for getting Quick Benchmarks Before Playing a game (or maybe coding too)

All You need is python to run all this (ill maybe upload an exe file for it aswell), rest run all this in terminal and then you will get final score after running all this
For More updates im currently working on making a gui using tkinter on this like my last project which is pretty good
