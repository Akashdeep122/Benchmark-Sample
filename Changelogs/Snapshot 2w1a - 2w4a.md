# -> Snapshot 2w1a <-
## -> Major Update(Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements),Stable but bit bugged <-

### Changes
1. New library Threading is added (for performance improvements / smoothness)
2. Now all the updates promised in 2w beta actually work
3. Fixed the window was not showing up(imagine how could you really use your program lol)
4. Fixed the error while running it would give error of timereps object not found
5. Updates percentage done so that you can see how much is done(earlier it used to just hang and show the result, which destroys your processor)

###Information
1. This program needs Threading module and shutil too (will remove shutil later its unneccary)
2. This program is smoother but has got a bug (Which will be fixed on later) which makes it do 40 process interval instead of 20 resulting in more processor usage
3. The benchmark score will be alot more than it actually is 

# -> Snapshot 2w2a <-
## -> Important Update(important bug fixes and performance improvements),Stable <-

### Changes
1. Removed the timereps function(one bug was working so we fixed it)
2. Now no longer the intervals are doubled (earlier they were cuz of a mistake)
3. Now it has a new Window title(Ealier you would just see tk which was not intended)

### Information
1. We still havent removed shutil module and fixed most of the errors
2. Newer updates might be a new exe file and window icon
3. Benchmark score increase is fixed(as it should be)
