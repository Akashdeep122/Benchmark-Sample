# -> Snapshot 2w7a <-
## -> Minor Update(Bug Fixes),Non-Functional <-


### Information
1. This program had some git Glitches and due to that it actually deleted the file once and added it back with some unneccary lines of code (i dont know why)
2. Snapshot 2w8a will fix them

# -> Snapshot 2w8a <-
## -> Important Update(Bug Fixes),Stable <-

### Changes
1. This program has fixed git issues
2. Now it will scan the path of the file itself (just dont rename the png file or else)

### Information
1. Only works in python 3.8 and below sadly because 3.9 changes the default(_'_file_'_) function from relative to absolut path
